                        <p>Custom software development, also known as custom software engineering, defines omitting of
                            predeveloped (template or boxed) solutions and views. If a customer wants to believe that
                            their favour is unique and putting their ideas into practice, custom software development
                            technologies are custom approaches to solving their problems. Finding new creative decisions
                            in order to meet the specific requirements and preferences of the customer as quickly as
                            possible may be achieved with custom software development.
                        </p>
                        <p>A goal of custom software solutions may be to develop not for the mass auditorium (users),
                            but rather developed to be unique, for a single customer (user) or a group. Custom developed
                            software is encouraged to take under one hat the most progressive technologies alone with
                            preferences and expectations of the customer. Custom developed software may be designed in
                            stage by stage processes, allowing all nuances and possible hidden dangers to be taken into
                            account, including issues which were not mentioned in the specifications.</p>
                        <p>Pre-developed software packages, in most cases, may not be modifiable or customized to ones
                            needs; and are usually available to all unrelated users or groups of users. For example,
                            software designed for a cell phone manufacturer would be 'custom,' even though there could
                            be thousands of individual users. Software written for use by many other manufacturers would
                            be packaged, even if there were only a single user in each factory. GNWebsoft Worldwide

                            custom database programming, distributed website and web application development, etc.
